# Security Measures

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our project to protect users and data.

## 1. Overview
Security is a crucial aspect of our application, and we take measures to ensure the safety of our users and their data. The following sections detail the dependencies and configurations we employ to maintain a secure environment.

## 2. Dependencies

### **2.1 Helmet**
Helmet is middleware used to secure apps by setting various HTTP headers. It helps mitigate common web vulnerabilities.

- **X-Frame-Options**: 
  - **Configuration**: Set to `DENY`.
  - **Reason**: Prevents clickjacking attacks by disallowing the site from being embedded in an iframe. This ensures that the content cannot be loaded on other sites, protecting user interactions.

- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**:
  - **Configuration**: `maxAge: 31536000`, `preload: true`, `includeSubDomains: false`.
  - **Reason**: Forces clients to only connect to the server using HTTPS, reducing the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks. The `preload` option allows browsers to automatically enforce this policy before the user has even visited the site.

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  - **Configuration**: 
    ```javascript
    helmet.contentSecurityPolicy({
      directives: {
        defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
        scriptSrc: ["'self'", "https://trusted-cdn.com"],
        objectSrc: ["'none'"],
        upgradeInsecureRequests: [],
      },
    });
    ```
  - **Reason**: Mitigates attacks such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by controlling which resources can be loaded. By restricting `defaultSrc` to `'self'`, we only allow resources to be loaded from our own domain.

### **2.2 CORS**
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is used to control access to resources based on the origin of the request.

- **Configuration**:
  ```javascript
  const corsOptions = {
    origin: (origin, callback) => {
      if (!origin || whitelist.includes(origin)) {
        callback(null, true);
      } else {
        callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'));
      }
    },
    methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE'],
    allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization'],
    credentials: true,
    optionsSuccessStatus: 200,
  };
  app.use(cors(corsOptions));
  ```
- **Reason**: 
  - The `origin` function checks if the request's origin is included in a predefined whitelist. This restricts access to only trusted domains, preventing unauthorized access from malicious sites.
  - The `allowedHeaders` option ensures that only specific headers can be included in requests, further enhancing security.

### **2.3 Express Validator**
Express Validator is a set of middleware functions that validate and sanitize incoming requests.

- **Configuration**: 
  Utilize validators in routes to ensure that all user inputs meet specific criteria, such as required fields, data types, and length constraints.
- **Reason**: Validating inputs helps prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL Injection and XSS by ensuring that only expected data formats are processed.

### **2.4 Firebase Security Measures**
Firebase provides robust security features that we leverage to protect our application.

- **Token Management**:
  - **Configuration**: All requests to the API require a Bearer token managed by Firebase.
  - **Reason**: This ensures that only authenticated users can access the API. Invalid or expired tokens result in nullified requests, preventing unauthorized access.

- **Firestore Security Rules**:
  - **Configuration**: Firestore security rules are used to define access permissions based on user authentication status and roles.
  - **Reason**: These rules control who can read and write to Firestore, ensuring that users can only access their own data or specific resources they're authorized to view.

## 3. HTTP Headers
- **Other Security Headers**: 
  - In addition to Helmet configurations, we employ various other security headers that further harden our application against attacks.

## 4. Monitoring and Logging
We utilize `morgan` for logging HTTP requests and integrate monitoring services for real-time threat detection.

## 5. Security Best Practices Followed
We follow best practices such as regular dependency updates and security-focused code reviews.

## 6. Future Improvements
We plan to implement additional security measures in future updates.
